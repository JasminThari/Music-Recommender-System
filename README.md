# Music Recommendation System: An Ensemble Approach to Music Recommender Systems

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Download the Data:**
   - Obtain the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CCxpRPAHrz0t0INvGaSrpf7OLOg6fE0D?usp=sharing).
   - Place the downloaded data into the `data/raw` directory at the root of the project.

2. **Unpack the Data:**
   - Unzip the files within the `data/raw` directory.

**Note:** Many parts of the code are computationally intensive, and some model training steps require a GPU. To simplify execution, we have provided preprocessed data in the `data/processed` folder. This allows you to skip the data preprocessing steps and run the notebook directly.

Additionally, we have saved the trained Autoencoder model and the compressed latent space in the `models` directory.

The generated recommendations are saved in the `results` folder.
