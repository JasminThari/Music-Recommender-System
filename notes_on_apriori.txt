Notes on Apriori / PCY algorithm.

Give concrete examples of how we can reduce the memory requirements in our case. 
Give an argument for how to store; triples vs other method (triangle one)
Give an argument for whether PCY algorithm makes sense

Determine how large "item sets" we are going to look for.
It could work with just pairs. And then just going through each song in a users playlist. 
Find the pair this song is in with the highest lift / the other measure. 
Then either take one for each song. OR compare the lift for all the found pairs and choose the most probable first.
